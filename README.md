## Getting Started:

### After Installation:
 - Select a avatar from the Edit Avatar widget and your avatar will load into the chat system and will visualize your avatar into your studio orb.
 - You are also able to disable the talking sounds with the **Toggle Mute** Button for a *less annoying* experience if you do not enjoy hearing sounds inside of studio.
### Using the Music System:
 - Add music entries by pasting the Audio ID of your choice into the TextBox under the Song Position Label
 - Your preference of muting talking sounds will not interfere with the music being played

## Rojo Usage:
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "Wispy.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `Wispy.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
